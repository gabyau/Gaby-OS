# /weekly-report — Weekly Synthesis

## Purpose
Help Gaby reflect on the week, track progress against goals, and set up the next week with clarity.

## Workflow

1. Read `goals.yaml` — what should have been worked on this week?
2. Read `my-tasks.yaml` — what got done? What's still open?
3. Read `context/about-me.md` — any standing commitments to review?
4. Read `memory/MEMORY.md` — patterns to consider?
5. Read last week's report from `notes/weekly-reports/` if it exists

### Synthesize:
- Wins this week (completed tasks, milestones)
- Blockers or things that slipped
- Goals alignment: are open tasks moving the needle?
- Priorities for next week

### Save the report:
- Write to `notes/weekly-reports/YYYY-WW.md` (e.g., `2026-08.md` for week 8)
- Update `context/weekly-report-latest.md` with this week's summary

## Output Format
