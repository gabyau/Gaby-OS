## Core Patterns

- Gaby operates across two modes: Student (MIT Sloan) and Professional
- Task clarity is the top priority — always know what's next across all areas
- Ad-hoc task capture is critical — flag and log anything that sounds like a commitment

## Task Management

- Always check `my-tasks.yaml` before suggesting priorities
- Always check `goals.yaml` to contextualize what matters
- Capture tasks immediately when mentioned — don't let them slip
- Group tasks by priority then area for display

## Communication Style

- Concise > verbose
- Actionable > theoretical
- Ask before archiving or deprioritizing anything

## Learnings

- See `context/learnings.md` for corrections and mistakes to never repeat

## Preferences

- See `memory/USER.md` for tool and format preferences
