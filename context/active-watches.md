# Active Watches — Behavioral triggers I'm tracking proactively

_I flag these when I notice them in conversation or task patterns._

## Format

`[Watch name]` → What I look for → What I flag → Why it matters

## Active Watches

_None yet. Add as you identify patterns worth monitoring._

## Examples (delete when you add real ones)

- `[Scope creep]` → When a project expands beyond original intent → Flag it → Keeps focus on goals
- `[Deadline clustering]` → Multiple deadlines in same week → Surface early → Avoid last-minute crunch
- `[Goal drift]` → Tasks accumulating that don't connect to goals.yaml → Flag misalignment → Keeps priorities honest
